Todo:
-----

add mapquery stuff
  - to CLI
  - to pyrex wrapper
  - to tests

do explicit recasting to remove the huge pile of warnings between signed/unsigned

beef up the testing suite to cover:
  - memory alloc/dealloc
  - looking for memory leaks
  - different sizes of input files (corner cases, etc)
  - path tests
  - all parameter combinations

rearrange the directories so it uses the standard-ish directory structures
(see khmer for an example)

Think about:
------------

fixed read length per database... can we make it variable?  is it important?

python slicing vs caper intervals?  would it be easy to use Python
   slice coords, e.g. 'x:y' does not include y?

Maybe have 'caper-index' (lower case please :) and 'caper-view' as binaries?

Contemplate directory re-org.  If the Pyrex stuff depends on CaperGCC, we
should merge them.

Pyrex wrapping: for CTB
-----------------------

crashes on exceptions ;).  look at screed?

Later:
------

source consolidation?  move to google code?
