Minor issues:
-------------

ReadMe.txt => README.txt

remove print output from library!

FIXME:
------

'-f' doesn't complain when the saved refgenomeindex file is not available;
ditto for '-i'.

silent failure if cache files can't be written to, as well.

generate 'black box' cache: take in prefix, copy mapping file etc. under
that prefix; following that, we can delete/rename/etc original files.

orientation etc.

Think about:
------------

fixed read length per database... can we make it variable?  is it important?

python slicing vs caper intervals?  would it be easy to use Python
   slice coords, e.g. 'x:y' does not include y?

Pyrex wrapping: for CTB
-----------------------

crashes on exceptions ;).  look at screed?

NLMSASlice

extract read length from database.

Later:
------

how do we want to deal with memory management?  silly to dup Mappings...?

source consolidation?  move to google code?

benchmarking of course...
